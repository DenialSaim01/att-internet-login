You’ll need to provide your AT&T internet account number or phone number associated with your internet service and your ZIP code. After verifying your identity, you’ll set up a User ID and Password that you’ll use every time you log in.

Make sure to use a valid email address during registration, as it will be used for account alerts and password recovery.
